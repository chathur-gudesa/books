- Logic circuits 
	- Combinational
		- Output determined by inputs 
	- Sequential 
		- Output determined by inputs + state (memory)

- Net
	- Physical connections between hw components
	- outputs of continuous assignments / connection signals between modules
	- e.g.: *wire*

- Variables 
	- Abstract storage 
		- does not necessarily infer phsyical storage component
	- Output of procedural assignments
	- e.g. reg

- Program body 
	- continuous assignment 
	- always block
	- module instantiation

- Structural description 
	- instantiating other modules

- $stop 
	- system function to stop simualation 

- initial construct
	- used in testbench
	- executed once at the beginning
