- Development flow
	- HDL core + constraint + testbench 
	- RTL simulation
	- Synthesis
		- translate hdl construct to gates / FFs 
	- Implementation
		- translate
			- merge multiple design files into a single netlist
				- netlist: detailed description of electronic circuit that lists all components and interconnections
		- map
			- maps generic gates to FPGA's logic cells and IOBs
		- place and route
			- derive physical layout inside the FPGA
		- static timing analysis
			- performed at end of impl
			- determines maximal propagation delay 
			- determines maximal clock frequency
	- download configuration file to FPGA
	- functional simulation: after synthesis (not needed if HDL is good)
	- timing simulation: after implementation

- user-constraint file 
	- defines minimal clock frequency, signal to pin mappings
